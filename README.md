Welcome to the page that contains the Python scripts I used for my bachelor thesis!

In my thesis, I studied the segmentation clock in mice embryogenesis. Specifically, I created a model of differential equations based on models by Goodwin (1960), Collier (1996) and McDonnell (2025). Using this equations the interactions between Hes-protein and Delta ligand are modelled. The connecting interaction with Notch is removed from the system. 

I then created some P)yhton code files in which the concentrations of Hes and Delta can be determined for all cells on a 1D array. The length of the array can be set.

Such simple models (specifically, the two-variable model) allow for quick simulations which, using the right parameters and initial conditions, can provide behaviour found in mice embryonic tail development.
